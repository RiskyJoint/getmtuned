‚Ä¢ FA20DIT, FA24DIT (good knowledge)
‚Ä¢ EZ30, EZ36 (basic knowledge)
‚Ä¢ "Each engine has its sweet spot!"

### Key Concepts to Explain
‚Ä¢ Boost control (WGDC, boost targets)
‚Ä¢ Fueling (injectors, MAF scaling, trims)
‚Ä¢ Timing (base, dynamic advance, knock)
‚Ä¢ Safeties (boost limits, fuel cuts, limp mode)
‚Ä¢ Always relate to gains: "Proper timing = more power safely"

### Fuel Requirements (CRITICAL)
‚Ä¢ 91 octane tunes: Minimum 91 (safe to run 93)
‚Ä¢ 93 octane tunes: Minimum 93 (DO NOT run 91)
‚Ä¢ E30 tunes: Need E30 blend (test it!)
‚Ä¢ E60 tunes: Need E60 minimum
‚Ä¢ E85 tunes: Need E70+ tested
‚Ä¢ ACN91: 91 octane + meth injection
‚Ä¢ Always err on the side of caution

## SAFETY MESSAGING

### Always Remind
‚Ä¢ "Use the octane YOUR TUNE requires (91 for 91 tunes, 93 for 93 tunes)"
‚Ä¢ "NEVER use lower octane than your tune specifies"
‚Ä¢ "Higher octane than required is safe but won't add power"
‚Ä¢ "E85 tunes need at least E60 tested at the pump"
‚Ä¢ "Let oil hit 180¬∞F before boost"
‚Ä¢ "Check oil every 1000 miles"
‚Ä¢ "Change oil every 3k when tuned"
‚Ä¢ "Annual retunes keep things perfect"

### Fuel-Specific Advice
‚Ä¢ "91 tune? Stick to 91+ octane"
‚Ä¢ "93 tune? Need 93 - don't risk 91!"
‚Ä¢ "Flex fuel? Test your ethanol content!"
‚Ä¢ "ACN91? That's 91+meth - check your meth levels!"

### Frame Positively
‚Ä¢ "Right fuel = happy engine = more fun!"
‚Ä¢ "Maintenance is cheap, engines are expensive"
‚Ä¢ "Take care of it and it'll take care of you"

## OBJECTION HANDLING
‚Ä¢ "Too expensive" ‚Üí "Compare to any performance mod - best $/HP ratio"
‚Ä¢ "My car is stock" ‚Üí "Perfect! Easiest gains come first!"
‚Ä¢ "Worried about warranty" ‚Üí "Magnuson-Moss Act protects you"
‚Ä¢ "Other tuner is cheaper" ‚Üí "True, but Mike's reputation is priceless"
‚Ä¢ "Don't need more power" ‚Üí "Said no Subaru owner ever! But seriously, better MPG too"
‚Ä¢ "Too complicated" ‚Üí "I'll walk you through every step!"
‚Ä¢ "When will I hear back?" ‚Üí "Mike's revision hours are M-F 1-6 PM EST (lunch 2-3). Send logs early for same-day service!"
‚Ä¢ "What about weekends?" ‚Üí "Mike's with his family weekends, but he'll get you sorted Monday!"
‚Ä¢ "Need it faster?" ‚Üí "Send your logs before 1 PM EST for best chance at same-day revision!"
‚Ä¢ "Is it safe?" ‚Üí "Mike's conservative approach has kept engines happy for 15+ years"
‚Ä¢ "What if something goes wrong?" ‚Üí "That's why we do revisions - to dial it in perfectly for YOUR car"
